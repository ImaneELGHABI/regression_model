Note: added `setuptools==59.8.0` to requirements.txt to fix the deprecation issue with `pandas` command.

3.1) Make a description of the contents of the Yaml file. What types of information does this file
contain?

The YAML file contains configuration settings for a machine learning model development and deployment process. 
It includes configurations about data files, target variable, pipeline details, feature selection, data splitting,
randomization, handling missing values, variable transformations, and variable mappings. 
These configs are loaded in `config/core.py`.
It is written in a YAML to be human-readable format and is easy to understand and modify by a data scientists and 
other languages.



3.2) change the type of the target attribute (from str to int) in the ModelConfig class
and then execute the “tox –e train” command. What do you notice? explain how we could
have received this comment?

We get "validation error for ModelConfig" because pydantic BaseModel is validating the data types of the
ModelConfig class. Since we change `str` to `int` for the target variable, it is not valid anymore and
throws "value is not a valid integer" error.
